A-click on the digit, this will result in the temporary string to concat on the target value '8', and calHistory will reflect the changes made by temporary, so does currentDisplay, the clearDisplay remains C
B-click on the modifier, this will result in change the temporary value to opposite, and calHistory will reflect the changes made by temporary, so does currentDisplay, the clearDisplay remains C
C-click on the percentage, this will result in temporary to divide by 100, and calHistory will reflect the changes made by temporary, so does currentDisplay, the clearDisplay remains C
D-click on the clear, this will result in temporary to be default empty, and calHistory will back to default empty, the currentDisplay will back to default '0', the clearDisplay also back to default AC
E-click on the decimal, this will result in the temporary string to concat on the target value '.', and calHistory will reflect the changes made by temporary, so does currentDisplay, the clearDisplay remains C
F-click on the delete, this will result in temporary to be default empty, and calHistory will back to default empty, the currentDisplay will back to default '0', the clearDisplay also back to default AC
G-click on the equal, this will take no effect
H-click on the operator, this will result in temporary to be stored as the first input, and the target operator will be stored in tempOperator,
